    "In the previous lesson you saw how to use a CNN to make your recognition of the handwriting digits more efficient. In this lesson you'll take that to the next level, recognizing real images of Cats and Dogs in order to classify an incoming image as one or the other. In particular the handwriting recognition made your life a little easier by having all the images be the same size and shape, and they were all monochrome color. Real-world images aren't like that -- they're in different shapes, aspect ratios etc, and they're usually in color!\n",

    "As you can see, we are **overfitting** like it's getting out of fashion. Our training accuracy (in blue) gets close to 100% (!) while our validation accuracy (in orange) stalls as 70%. Our validation loss reaches its minimum after only five epochs.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we have a relatively small number of training examples (2000), overfitting should be our number one concern. Overfitting happens when a model exposed to too few examples learns patterns that do not generalize to new data, i.e. when the model starts using irrelevant features for making predictions. For instance, if you, as a human, only see three images of people who are lumberjacks, and three images of people who are sailors, and among them the only person wearing a cap is a lumberjack, you might start thinking that wearing a cap is a sign of being a lumberjack as opposed to a sailor. You would then make a pretty lousy lumberjack/sailor classifier.\n",

    "Overfitting is the central problem in machine learning: given that we are fitting the parameters of our model to a given dataset, how can we make sure that the representations learned by the model will be applicable to data never seen before? How do we avoid learning things that are specific to the training data?\n",
