Course 2 - Device-based Models with TensorFlow Lite â€“ Ungraded Labs and Programming Assignments
===========================================================================

This repository contains the ungraded labs and programming assignments that accompany Course 2 - Device-based Models with TensorFlow Lite of the TensorFlow for Data and Deployment Specialization at Coursera. 

# Jupyter Notebooks

The Jupyter notebooks in the ungraded labs and programming assignments in this course can be run locally or in Google's [Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/notebooks/welcome.ipynb). We should note that certain cells in the notebooks contain code or interactive forms that will only render when executed in the Colab environment. Therefore, we recommend running the notebooks in the Colab environment. You will still be able run the notebooks locally on your machine without any modifications to the code, so feel free to work locally if you prefer. If you work locally make sure you have installed TensorFlow 2.0 and TensorFlow Hub 0.7.0. 


Have fun learning TensorFlow Lite!
